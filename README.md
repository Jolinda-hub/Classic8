# Classification_model_notebook
A launch of the streamlit app, explanitory data analysis and a Machine Learning Classification model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

This can providing a solution to this task giving companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.
