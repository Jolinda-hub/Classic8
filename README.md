# Classification_model_notebook
A launch of the streamlit app, explanitory data analysis and a Machine Learning Classification model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

This can providing a solution to this task giving companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

# Data contains:
Train.csv - is the dataset that is used to train the model. Test.csv - is the dataset on which you will apply your model to.

The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets were collected.

# Packages/Modules needed for the model
nltk.download() - The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform that assists us in building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.

These text processing libraries allow us to form accurate analysis based on the tweets concerning climate change.

# Installations before running model
pip install wordcloud - A Wordcloud is a visual representation of text data. It displays a list of words, the importance of each being shown with font size or color. Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud.

pip install streamlit  -
